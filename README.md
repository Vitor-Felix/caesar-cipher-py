## About ROT-N cipher
> According to [dCode](https://www.dcode.fr/rot-cipher):

Rot-N/Rot cipher is a simple character substitution based on a shift/rotation of N letters in an alphabet. E.g. one letter is replaced by another (always the same) that is located further (exactly N letters further) in the alphabet.

This is the basis of the famous Caesar code and its many variants modifying the shift. The most popular variant is the ROT13 which has the advantage of being reversible with our 26 letters alphabet (the encryption or decryption operations are identical because 13 is half of 26).
